# Stock Price Prediction Model

## Overview
This project demonstrates a machine learning model designed to predict stock prices using historical data from Yahoo Finance. The model uses the **Random Forest Regressor** to predict Apple's stock prices (AAPL) and evaluates its accuracy. Additionally, the project includes visualizations of actual vs predicted prices.

## Files

- **`stock_predic.py`**: Python script that:
  - Downloads historical stock data for Apple Inc.
  - Trains a Random Forest model to predict stock prices.
  - Generates a graph comparing actual vs predicted stock prices.
  - Saves the predictions in a CSV file (`stock_predictions.csv`).

- **`stock_predictions.R`**: R script that:
  - Loads the `stock_predictions.csv` file.
  - Generates a plot comparing actual vs predicted stock prices.
  - Saves the plot as a PNG file (`stock_plot.png`).

- **`stock_predictions.csv`**: A CSV file containing the actual and predicted stock prices (generated by the Python script).

- **`stock_plot.png`**: A plot generated by the Python script showing actual vs predicted stock prices and by the R file as well in RStudio.

## How to Run

### 1. Run the Python Script
Start by running the Python script to train the model, generate predictions, and create the graph:
In the terminal run (`python stock_predic.py`) which will:
Download historical stock data for Apple Inc.
Train the Random Forest Regressor model on the stock data.
Save the predicted stock prices and actual values in stock_predictions.csv.
Generate a graph showing the actual vs predicted stock prices and save it as stock_plot.png.

### 2. Visualize the Results in R
Once the Python script has been run and stock_predictions.csv is generated, use the R script to create a plot comparing the actual vs predicted stock prices:
(`source("stock_predictions.R")`)
- This will: Load the predictions from stock_predictions.csv. Generate a plot comparing actual vs predicted stock prices. Save the plot as stock_plot.png.

### Dependencies

Python Dependencies:
Install the required Python libraries:
pip install yfinance pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
R Dependencies:
Install the required R libraries:
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("readr")

### Model Details
- Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor
- Evaluation Metrics:
Mean Squared Error (MSE), 
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), 
R-squared (R²).

### Results
The Python script outputs the following metrics to evaluate the model's performance:
MSE: Measures the average of the squared differences between actual and predicted values.
RMSE: Measures the square root of the average squared differences.
R²: Represents the proportion of variance explained by the model.

### Notes
This model demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to predict stock prices based on historical data.
Although the model achieves high accuracy, stock market predictions are inherently uncertain and should not be used for actual trading decisions.
